## Game planning
+ _A random number between 1 and 10 is generated
+ _Player 1 and Player 2 take turns "guessing" the number (a random number is generated for Player 1 and then for Player 2, and on until somebody matches the initial number.)
+ _If Player 1 matches the number, they win. If not, a number is generated for Player 2.
+ _If Player 2 matches the number, they win. If not, another number is generated for Player 1. 
+ _This continues until either Player 1 or Player 2 matches the number.
+ _Play as many rounds as you would like. Each round, alternate who gets the first guess.
