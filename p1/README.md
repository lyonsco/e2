## Game planning
+ A random number between 1 and 10 is generated
+ Player 1 and Player 2 take turns "guessing" the number (Create and shuffle an array with the numbers 1 through 10 for each to guess from. This ensures there will not be duplicate guesses.)
+ Pop a value from the guesses array and assign it to PLayer 1, and pop another value and assign it to Player 2. 
+ If Player 1 matches the number, they win. If Player 2 matches the numbber, they win. If neither guesses the number, there is no winner and the game continues to Round 2.
+ In Round 2, pop a value from the guesses array and assign it to Player 1, and pop another value and assign it to Player 2. 
+ If Player 1 matches the number, they win. If Player 2 matches the numbber, they win. If neither guesses the number, there is no winner and the game continues to Round 3.
+ This continues until either Player 1 or Player 2 matches the number. The maximum number of rounds is five because there are 10 numbers to choose from between the two players.
