    <h1>Number Matching Game</h1>

    <h2>Mechanics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A random number between 1 and 10 is generated for Player 1.</li>
        <li>Player 2 needs to match that number in as few tries as possible.</li>
        <li>A random number between 1 and 10 is generated for Player 2.</li>
        <li>If Player 1's number matches Player 2's number, they get 1 point. If not, another random number is generated
            for Player 2.</li>
        <li>If this second number matches Payer 1's, Player 2 gets 2 points. And so on until there is a match./li>
        <li>Once Player 2 matches Player 1's number, it is Player 2's turn to start with a random number for Player 1 to
            match.</li>
        <li>Play as many rounds as you would like. The player with the lowest point total wins./li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Results</h2>
